Install Ruby using RVM:

1. What rvm used for?
Not only does RVM make installing multiple ruby interpreters / runtimes easy and consistent, it provides features such as gemsets that aren't typically supported out of the box on most ruby installs.
	RVM also lets you use different rubies in a manner that won't mess with your existing ruby 	install (unless you tell it to) as well as letting you run multiple different rubies in separate 	terminals concurrently!
2. What is ‘#’?

3.   Ruby program to find n’th number in fibonacci series:

  return  n  if ( 0..1 ).include? n
  ( fibonacci( n - 1 ) + fibonacci( n - 2 ) )

puts fibonacci( 8 )
            
            output:
            mrunal@mrunal-HP-15-Notebook-PC:~/Desktop$ ruby hi.rb

4. Ruby program to solve josephus problem:
def josephus(size, steps, survivors = 2)
  list = *1..size

  def list.[](i)
    fetch(i % length)
  end

  puts "Population #{list.length}, #{steps} steps, #{survivors} survivors"

  while list.length > survivors
    list.delete(list[steps-1])
    list.rotate!(steps-1)
  end

  puts "Position of survivors: #{list}"
end

puts josephus(6,2)
